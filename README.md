A moai is a group of individulas who trust each other and share liflong bonds that helps them feel connected, battling loneliness and financial hardships throughout their oldage.

The concept has been in practice for decades in okinawa,Japan contibuting to the longevity of people in the region. A variation of this can also be found in the villages of tamil nadu known as 'Magalir Suya Udhavi Kulu' (Women self help group).

Anyone can create a group(called a moai).They send out invites over email or share the link to join. A member can join via an invite link. Each member can only be part of one group with each moai having a maximum of 5 to 10 members.

Every month, each member pays a fixed amount before a set date of the month. Any amount which was missed can be paid within that calendar month incase of unforseen cirumstance, which will be added to the following month's pool. They will be able to view their past transactions in their My History.
This consistent savings is saved for any emergency requests by the members.

A calendar invite is created for every month to meet on huddle at the same time. Only members of the moai are invited,and the moai system enforces participation of all the members.
This continously communication creates a sense of community and builds relationship over decades.

Moai primarily is for having each other and being a safety net. When a member of the moai has an emergency situation, they can raise a request with the amount they need or anyone on their behalf to support them on finances. Atleast 51% of the members need to approve the request for it to pass through and the amount is passed on to the beneficiary.

In the event that no one has raised an emergency request the previous cycle where each cycle is 6 months, a member is chosen to receive the pool. This is done on mutual understanding and need basis. The goal is for everyone in the group to eventually receive the pot before the cycle repeats.

The currency used in usdc, in arc.

While this concept has been live with cash and in person meetings, a need for decentralized moai is necessary for a sustainable money and to resolve dsipersion of group from the geographic region for various reasons like job, studies etc. This is solved with huddle.

A member can leave the moai but will not seek any benefits on doing so. When a member of the moai passes away, any member can submit a register demise and upon approval of atleast 2 members, the demised member will be removed from the moai.
